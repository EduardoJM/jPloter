# jploter

This is a (in-development) math graph plot library (a little bit like the geogebra ploting) that i'm (Eduardo Oliveira) developing for i use in my other personal project.

This is in the first steps of the development and this README will be updated in the future.

## Compile the browser example

```bash
npm run ex
